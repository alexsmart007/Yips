Yips is an exciting game that utilizes advanced technology to create content, such as characters' voices, appearances, and dialogue. Our aim is to make the game feel authentic, blending elements made by both humans and AI, so players won't be able to tell the difference! The virus in the game is also created by the AI, and it has only three tries to get the symptoms right. We're delving into three key areas: voices, appearances, and character dialogue, to make the game incredibly cool and futuristic.
